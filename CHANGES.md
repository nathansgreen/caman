### Upgrading

#### Upgrading from 0.2.0

Host certificates are now created with the ``-notext`` option to suppress the
human-readable text summary at the top of certificates, as it unnecessarily
increases their file size, and can apparently cause problems for some systems.
If you haven't had any problems there is no need to modify existing host
certificates, but you can ``renew`` host certificates to generate new ones
without the text summary, or manually remove the text summaries from your
``.crt.pem`` and ``.keycrt.pem`` files (the human-readable section which
starts ``Certificate``, before ``-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----``).

No other changes are required for this version; your existing CA can be used as
a root CA without any changes to its config, or to certificates which are
already in use.


#### Upgrading from 0.1.0

The file ``ca/caconfig.cnf.default`` has been changed, so you need to update
your customised ``caconfig/host.cnf``:
* The section ``[ CA_default ]`` has a new setting ``copy_extensions = copy``


The file ``ca/host.cnf.default`` has been changed, and your customised
``ca/host.cnf`` needs to be changed too:
* The ``organizationalUnitName`` now has to be set manually in this file;
  change ``<<OUN>>`` to an appropriate value for your certificates. This can
  be changed manually on a per-host basis once you have run the ``new`` command.
* In the section ``[ v3_req ]``, after the line ``keyUsage``, add the line
  ``<<ALT_HOSTNAMES>>``

The changes to ``ca/host.cnf`` do not affect the configuration for existing
hosts.

* The ``new`` command no longer accepts an OUN; this now has to be set manually
  in your ``ca/host.cnf``, and customised per-host as necessary after running
  ``new``.
